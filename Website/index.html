     <h2>AIR POLLUTTION</h2>
     <div class="home1">
       <h3>Introduction</h3>
       <p>Air pollution is a mix of hazardous substances from both human-made and natural sources. Air pollution is a familiar environmental health hazard. We know what weâ€™re looking at when brown haze settles over a city, exhaust billows across a busy highway, or a plume rises from a smokestack. Some air pollution is not seen, but its pungent smell alerts you.</p>
       <p>From smog hanging over cities to smoke inside the home, air pollution poses a major threat to health and climate. The combined effects of ambient (outdoor) and household air pollution cause about seven million premature deaths every year, largely as a result of increased mortality from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and acute respiratory infections.</p>

       <h3>Health and Environmental Effects</h3>
       <p>Even healthy people can experience health impacts from polluted air including respiratory irritation or breathing difficulties during exercise or outdoor activities. Your actual risk of adverse effects depends on your current health status, the pollutant type and concentration, and the length of your exposure to the polluted air. It can also cause other health problems including:</p>
       <ul>
         <li>Aggravated respiratory disease such as emphysema, bronchitis and asthma</li>
         <li>Lung damage, even after symptoms such as coughing or a sore throat disappear</li>
         <li>Wheezing, chest pain, dry throat, headache or nausea</li>
         <li>Reduced resistance to infections</li>
         <li>Increased fatigue and weakened athletic performance</li>
       </ul>
